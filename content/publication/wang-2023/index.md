abstract: Methanol (CH3OH) has attracted considerable attention as a renewable fuel
  or fuel additive with low greenhouse gas emissions. Methanol oxidation was studied
  using a recently developed supercritical pressure jet-stirred reactor (SP-JSR) at
  pressures of 10 and 100 atm, at temperatures from 550 to 950 K, and at equivalence
  ratios of 0.1, 1.0, and 9.0 in experiments and simulations. The experimental results
  show that the onset temperature of CH3OH oxidation at 100 atm is around 700 K, which
  is more than 100 K lower than the onset at 10 atm and this trend cannot be predicted
  by the existing kinetics models. Furthermore, a negative temperature coefficient
  (NTC) behavior was clearly observed at 100 atm at fuel rich conditions for methanol
  for the first time. To understand the observed temperature shift in the reactivity
  and the NTC effect, we updated some key elementary reaction rates of relevance to
  high pressure CH3OH oxidation from the literature and added some new low-temperature
  reaction pathways such as CH2O + HO2 = HOCH2O2 (RO2), RO2 + RO2 = HOCH2O (RO) +
  HOCH2O (RO) + O2, and CH3OH + RO2 = CH2OH + HOCH2O2H (ROOH). Although the model
  with these updates improves the prediction somewhat for the experimental data at
  100 atm and reproduces well high-temperature ignition delay times and laminar flame
  speed data in the literature, discrepancies still exist for some aspects of the
  100 atm low-temperature oxidation data. In addition, it was found that the pressure-dependent
  HO2 chemistry shifts to lower temperature as the pressure increases such that the
  NTC effect at fuel-lean conditions is suppressed. Therefore, as shown in the experiments,
  the NTC phenomenon was only observed at the fuel-rich condition where fuel radicals
  are abundant and the HO2 chemistry at high pressure is weakened by the lack of oxygen
  resulting in comparatively little HO2 formation.
