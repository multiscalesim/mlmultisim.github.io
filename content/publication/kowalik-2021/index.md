abstract: Molecular insights into graphene-catalyst surface interactions can provide
  useful information for the efficient design of copper current collectors with graphitic
  anode interfaces. As graphene bending can affect the local electron density, it
  should reflect its local reactivity as well. Using ReaxFF reactive molecular simulations,
  we have investigated the possible bending of graphene in vacuum and near copper
  surfaces. We describe the energy cost for graphene bending and the binding energy
  with hydrogen and copper with two different ReaxFF parameter sets, demonstrating
  the relevance of using the more recently developed ReaxFF parameter sets for graphene
  properties. Moreover, the draping angle at copper step edges obtained from our atomistic
  simulations is in good agreement with the draping angle determined from experimental
  measurements, thus validating the ReaxFF results.
