abstract: Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations
  are performed to provide insight into the effects of external electrostatic fields
  on hydrocarbon reaction kinetics. By comparing the results from MD and DFT, the
  suitability of the MD method in modeling electrodynamics is first assessed. Results
  show that the electric field-induced polarization predicted by the MD charge equilibration
  method is in good agreement with various DFT charge partitioning schemes. Then,
  the effects of oriented external electric fields on the transition pathways of non-redox
  reactions are investigated. Results on the minimum energy path suggest that electric
  fields can cause catalysis or inhibition of oxidation reactions, whereas pyrolysis
  reactions are not affected due to the weaker electronegativity of the hydrogen and
  carbon atoms. MD simulations of isolated reactions show that the reaction kinetics
  is also affected by applied external Lorentz forces and interatomic Coulomb forces
  since they can increase or decrease the energy of collision depending on the molecular
  conformation. In addition, electric fields can affect the kinetics of polar species
  and force them to align in the direction of field lines. These effects are attributed
  to energy transfer via intermolecular collisions and stabilization under the external
  Lorentz force. The kinetics of apolar species is not significantly affected mainly
  due to the weak induced dipole moment even under strong electric fields. The dynamics
  and reaction rates of species are studied by means of large-scale combustion simulations
  of n-dodecane and oxygen mixtures. Results show that under strong electric fields,
  the fuel, oxidizer, and most product molecules experience translational and rotational
  acceleration mainly due to close charge transfer along with a reduction in their
  vibrational energy due to stabilization. This study will serve as a basis to improve
  the current methods used in MD and to develop novel methodologies for the modeling
  of macroscale reacting flows under external electrostatic fields.
