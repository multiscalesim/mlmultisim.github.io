abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride materials are isomorphs of
  carbon nanomaterials and hold promise for electronics applications owing to their
  unique properties. Despite the recent advances in synthesis, the current production
  capacity for boron nitride (BN) nanostructures is far behind that for carbon-based
  nanostructures. Understanding the growth mechanism of BN nanostructures through
  modeling and experiments is key to improving this situation. In the current work,
  we present the development of a ReaxFF-based force field capable of modeling the
  gas-phase chemistry important for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis
  process. This force field is parameterized to model the boron nitride nanostructure
  (BNNS) formation in the gas phase using BN and HBNH as precursors. Our ReaxFF simulations
  show that BN is the best of these two precursors in terms of quality and the size
  of BNNSs. The BN precursors lead to the formation of closed BNNSs. However, BNNSs
  are replaced with complex polymeric structures at temperatures of 2500 K and higher
  due to entropic effects. Compared to the BN precursors, the HBNH precursors form
  relatively small, flat, and low-quality BNNSs, but this structure is less affected
  by temperature. Additives like H2 significantly affect the BNNS formation by preventing
  closed BNNS formation. Our results show the ReaxFF capability in predicting the
  BN gas-phase chemistry and BNNS formation, thus providing key insights for experimental
  synthesis.
