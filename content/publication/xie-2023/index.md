abstract: Plasmas can generate ultra-high-temperature reactive environments that can
  be used for the synthesis and processing of a wide range of materials1,2. However,
  the limited volume, instability and non-uniformity of plasmas have made it challenging
  to scalably manufacture bulk, high-temperature materials3â€“8. Here we present a plasma
  set-up consisting of a pair of carbon-fibre-tip-enhanced electrodes that enable
  the generation of a uniform, ultra-high temperature and stable plasma (up to 8,000
  K) at atmospheric pressure using a combination of vertically oriented long and short
  carbon fibres. The long carbon fibres initiate the plasma by micro-spark discharge
  at a low breakdown voltage, whereas the short carbon fibres coalesce the discharge
  into a volumetric and stable ultra-high-temperature plasma. As a proof of concept,
  we used this process to synthesize various extreme materials in seconds, including
  ultra-high-temperature ceramics (for example, hafnium carbonitride) and refractory
  metal alloys. Moreover, the carbon-fibre electrodes are highly flexible and can
  be shaped for various syntheses. This simple and practical plasma technology may
  help overcome the challenges in high-temperature synthesis and enable large-scale
  electrified plasma manufacturing powered by renewable electricity.
