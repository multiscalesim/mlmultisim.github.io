abstract: Biodiesel is being considered as a renewable fuel candidate to completely
  or partially replace fossil diesel. Understanding its combustion is key to assess
  its applicability in practical compression ignition engines. Significant progress
  has been made in understanding biodiesel combustion through experimental studies,
  development of reaction kinetics to describe its oxidation, and simulations in typical
  engine environments. The use of surrogates in place of the real biodiesels plays
  a crucial role in this endeavour. This chapter reviews the existing studies revolving
  around surrogate fuels for biodiesels. Thereafter, the challenges ahead in this
  context to further enhance our knowledge of biodiesel combustion are presented,
  and possible options to address these are discussed where appropriate.
