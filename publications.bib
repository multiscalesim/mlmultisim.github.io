abstract = {Low-temperature plasma catalysis holds promise for electrification of energy-intensive chemical processes such as methane reforming and ammonia synthesis. However, fundamental understanding of plasma-catalyst interactions, essential for catalyst design and screening for plasma catalysts, remains largely limited. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of first-principles studies, including density functional theory (DFT), for elucidating the role of electro- and photo-effects such as electric field and charge in plasma catalysis. The availability of increasing amounts of DFT data in thermal catalysis presents a unique opportunity for plasma catalysis research to efficiently leverage this existing first-principles knowledge of thermal catalysis towards investigating plasma-catalyst interactions. To this end, this paper investigates interpretable transfer learning from thermal to plasma catalysis, with a focus on the role of surface charge. Pre-trained attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Open Catalysis Project, trained using millions of thermal catalysis DFT data points, are structurally adapted to account for surface charge effects and fine-tuned using plasma catalysis DFT data of single metal atoms on Al$_2$O$_3$ support and adsorbates involved in plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. Not only the fine-tuned attention-based GNN model provides a high test accuracy for predicting adsorption energies and atomic forces in plasma catalysis, but also shows adequate extrapolation for unseen single metal atoms in the plasma catalysis data used for the model fine-tuning. To distinguish the effects of surface charge from other dissimilarities in DFT data of thermal and plasma catalysis, a dual-model framework is presented that relies on two pre-trained GNNs, one of which is specifically tasked to capture surface charge effects using an attention mechanism that provides interpretable insights into their role. Lastly, it is demonstrated how the attention-based GNNs developed for single metal atoms can be efficiently adapted for predicting adsorption energies and atomic forces for metal clusters in plasma catalysis. This work highlights the vast potential of interpretable transfer learning from thermal catalysis to plasma catalysis to mitigate excessive computational requirements of first-principles studies in plasma catalysis, towards accelerating fundamental research in this domain.},

@article{Wang2023,
abstract = {Methanol (CH3OH) has attracted considerable attention as a renewable fuel or fuel additive with low greenhouse gas emissions. Methanol oxidation was studied using a recently developed supercritical pressure jet-stirred reactor (SP-JSR) at pressures of 10 and 100 atm, at temperatures from 550 to 950 K, and at equivalence ratios of 0.1, 1.0, and 9.0 in experiments and simulations. The experimental results show that the onset temperature of CH3OH oxidation at 100 atm is around 700 K, which is more than 100 K lower than the onset at 10 atm and this trend cannot be predicted by the existing kinetics models. Furthermore, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior was clearly observed at 100 atm at fuel rich conditions for methanol for the first time. To understand the observed temperature shift in the reactivity and the NTC effect, we updated some key elementary reaction rates of relevance to high pressure CH3OH oxidation from the literature and added some new low-temperature reaction pathways such as CH2O + HO2 = HOCH2O2 (RO2), RO2 + RO2 = HOCH2O (RO) + HOCH2O (RO) + O2, and CH3OH + RO2 = CH2OH + HOCH2O2H (ROOH). Although the model with these updates improves the prediction somewhat for the experimental data at 100 atm and reproduces well high-temperature ignition delay times and laminar flame speed data in the literature, discrepancies still exist for some aspects of the 100 atm low-temperature oxidation data. In addition, it was found that the pressure-dependent HO2 chemistry shifts to lower temperature as the pressure increases such that the NTC effect at fuel-lean conditions is suppressed. Therefore, as shown in the experiments, the NTC phenomenon was only observed at the fuel-rich condition where fuel radicals are abundant and the HO2 chemistry at high pressure is weakened by the lack of oxygen resulting in comparatively little HO2 formation.},

abstract = {Plasmas can generate ultra-high-temperature reactive environments that can be used for the synthesis and processing of a wide range of materials1,2. However, the limited volume, instability and non-uniformity of plasmas have made it challenging to scalably manufacture bulk, high-temperature materials3â€“8. Here we present a plasma set-up consisting of a pair of carbon-fibre-tip-enhanced electrodes that enable the generation of a uniform, ultra-high temperature and stable plasma (up to 8,000 K) at atmospheric pressure using a combination of vertically oriented long and short carbon fibres. The long carbon fibres initiate the plasma by micro-spark discharge at a low breakdown voltage, whereas the short carbon fibres coalesce the discharge into a volumetric and stable ultra-high-temperature plasma. As a proof of concept, we used this process to synthesize various extreme materials in seconds, including ultra-high-temperature ceramics (for example, hafnium carbonitride) and refractory metal alloys. Moreover, the carbon-fibre electrodes are highly flexible and can be shaped for various syntheses. This simple and practical plasma technology may help overcome the challenges in high-temperature synthesis and enable large-scale electrified plasma manufacturing powered by renewable electricity.},

abstract = {Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations are performed to provide insight into the effects of external electrostatic fields on hydrocarbon reaction kinetics. By comparing the results from MD and DFT, the suitability of the MD method in modeling electrodynamics is first assessed. Results show that the electric field-induced polarization predicted by the MD charge equilibration method is in good agreement with various DFT charge partitioning schemes. Then, the effects of oriented external electric fields on the transition pathways of non-redox reactions are investigated. Results on the minimum energy path suggest that electric fields can cause catalysis or inhibition of oxidation reactions, whereas pyrolysis reactions are not affected due to the weaker electronegativity of the hydrogen and carbon atoms. MD simulations of isolated reactions show that the reaction kinetics is also affected by applied external Lorentz forces and interatomic Coulomb forces since they can increase or decrease the energy of collision depending on the molecular conformation. In addition, electric fields can affect the kinetics of polar species and force them to align in the direction of field lines. These effects are attributed to energy transfer via intermolecular collisions and stabilization under the external Lorentz force. The kinetics of apolar species is not significantly affected mainly due to the weak induced dipole moment even under strong electric fields. The dynamics and reaction rates of species are studied by means of large-scale combustion simulations of n-dodecane and oxygen mixtures. Results show that under strong electric fields, the fuel, oxidizer, and most product molecules experience translational and rotational acceleration mainly due to close charge transfer along with a reduction in their vibrational energy due to stabilization. This study will serve as a basis to improve the current methods used in MD and to develop novel methodologies for the modeling of macroscale reacting flows under external electrostatic fields.},

abstract = {Mass residence time distribution (RTD) is considered to be an important factor controlling the product selectivity in the pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes along with the pyrolysis chemistry. However, due to the complex pyrolysis chemistry of biomass and plastic waste, the coupling between the reaction chemistry, RTD, and product selectivity is challenging to understand. We introduce a reaction molecular dynamics-based method to examine pyrolysis chemistry and species timescales to assess the impact of RTD on product selectivity and yield. To validate this method, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for polypropylene pyrolysis and its non-equilibrium product selectivity using 6 different RTDs. We find that the RTD and the reaction chemistry control the peak non-equilibrium product concentrations. The peak monomer (C3H6) concentration during pyrolysis can be increased by up to 25 % by using a narrow RTD in the case of polypropylene pyrolysis. We also find that product selectivity is strongly affected by the average residence time and RTD. This coupling between the reaction chemistry, RTD, and product selectivity highlights the need to understand detailed reaction chemistry to control RTD and optimize non-equilibrium product selectivity during polymer and biomass pyrolysis. The present method provides a new way to design RTD for reactors to reach maximized product selectivity of plastic waste and biomass.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride materials are isomorphs of carbon nanomaterials and hold promise for electronics applications owing to their unique properties. Despite the recent advances in synthesis, the current production capacity for boron nitride (BN) nanostructures is far behind that for carbon-based nanostructures. Understanding the growth mechanism of BN nanostructures through modeling and experiments is key to improving this situation. In the current work, we present the development of a ReaxFF-based force field capable of modeling the gas-phase chemistry important for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis process. This force field is parameterized to model the boron nitride nanostructure (BNNS) formation in the gas phase using BN and HBNH as precursors. Our ReaxFF simulations show that BN is the best of these two precursors in terms of quality and the size of BNNSs. The BN precursors lead to the formation of closed BNNSs. However, BNNSs are replaced with complex polymeric structures at temperatures of 2500 K and higher due to entropic effects. Compared to the BN precursors, the HBNH precursors form relatively small, flat, and low-quality BNNSs, but this structure is less affected by temperature. Additives like H2 significantly affect the BNNS formation by preventing closed BNNS formation. Our results show the ReaxFF capability in predicting the BN gas-phase chemistry and BNNS formation, thus providing key insights for experimental synthesis.},

Therefore, there are currently several ongoing measurement strategies considering quality specification of LNG. In this context, for application in gas engines, it is essential to understand the combustion behavior of these natural gas mixtures. The methane number (MN) which represents a scale for the knocking propensity, is one of the main indicators for this combustion behavior. In this study, we investigated the influence of the LNG composition on the ignition delay time and thus the knocking behavior of prototypical LNG Mixtures. Several LNG typical mixtures containing CH4/C2H6/C3H8/n-C4H10/i-C4H10/n-C5H12/i-C5H12/N2 were studied in the temperature range 850â€“1450 K, with pressures of 20 and 40 bar and at equivalence ratios of 0.4 and 1.2. The use of a shock tube and a rapid compression machine facility allowed us to study the ignition behavior over a wide range of operating conditions relevant to gas engines.

abstract = {Biodiesel makes an attractive option to replace fossil diesel owing to its applicability in diesel engines without major modifications. An increase in NO emissions with biodiesel compared to diesel is a major concern for its wider use. Blending alcohols, such as methanol, with biodiesel is a potential remedy to mitigate NO formation, as suggested by experiments. However, computational investigations studying the effect of biodiesel-methanol blends on NO formation are scarce. A combined experimental and computational approach is adopted here to investigate the NO formation mechanism with neat biodiesel and biodiesel-methanol blend fueled light duty diesel engine. Firstly, a new compact kinetic model is utilized consisting of oxidation reactions for methyl butanoate and n-dodecane as a surrogate for biodiesel. A surrogate is defined to represent biodiesel based on a combined property and functional group based approach. This kinetic scheme is comprehensively validated for its component kinetics and available fundamental combustion experiments for biodiesel. Later, the suitability of the surrogate and the associated kinetic model is examined at engine conditions by comparing the predicted 3D CFD engine simulations with experiments for combustion and emission characteristics of neat biodiesel. The simulations performed using the surrogate show a good agreement with the experiments. Finally, a methanol sub-mechanism is incorporated in the biodiesel surrogate to investigate the effects of biodiesel-methanol blend. The addition of methanol causes minimal changes in the gross combustion parameters as shown by experiments as well as computations. However, it results in significant decrease in NO concentration, which is qualitatively captured by engine simulations. The computations provide additional insight into this effect providing a possible explanation for reduction in NO concentration with addition of methanol to biodiesel.},
